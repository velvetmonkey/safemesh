//! Delta-state G-Counter and PN-Counter for constrained mesh links.
//!
//! This crate is the PRODUCT half of the SafeMesh verification-guided loop:
//! a thin `no_std + alloc` implementation of exactly the model proven in
//! `lean/SafeMesh/` (carrier = join-semilattice, merge = join, delta =
//! single-coordinate bump), held to those proofs by a differential
//! conformance test (`tests/conformance.rs`) that replays a Lean-emitted
//! corpus through this code and requires byte-identical outputs.
//!
//! What is PROVEN (in Lean, kernel-checked) vs what is TESTED (here): the
//! Lean theorems are universal; this crate is checked against them over a
//! finite corpus. The bridge (Lean compiled eval → JSON → this crate) is the
//! named trusted component. See the repo README for the full TCB statement.
